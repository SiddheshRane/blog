I am Siddhesh Rane, a student from Pune, India.

I love full stack application development, theme designing and blogging.
I have done UI development in JavaFX and HTML and currently into distributed computing and databases.
I have tried my hands at natural language processing and see a future for it in the semantic web rather than deep learning. 
I talk in English, Hindi, Marathi and technical jargon!
