      <description><p>For my Btech project I had to process all articles in Wikipedia. The uncompressed dump of its plaintext is 14GB in size, which doesn’t sound like much until you run even a trivial word count pipeline on it. I had to do more than that, think matching 100 million labels over all the articles. It was no task for a single machine, so I used <a href="http://spark.apache.org">Spark</a> to distribute the load over a cluster of machines. In this post I’ll list everything that I wish I didn’t have to discover on my own.</p></description>

      <description><p>In my <a href="my-first-blog.html">previous</a> blog post I talked about how <a href="https://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a> got me into blogging but still ditched it in favour of <a href="http://jbake.org">JBake</a> In this post I’ll summarize all the important architectural differences between Jekyll and JBake and the factors that made me choose JBake.</p></description>

      <description><p>I was never really into blogging. Even today it’s not the conventional aspects of blogging that has got me started with one. In this post I will explore why I chose a static blog over the obvious choice of a Wordpress one.</p></description>
